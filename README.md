<p>PerÂ·eÂ·griÂ·nate

Which means to travel or wander around from place to place.

A synonym for traveler. 

This is our travel based app in which the final version will include flight info, currency conversion rates, flag, and general demographic of the country in order to ease the stress of traveling. Currently with our MVP we have included 2 sneak peaks of these features which are the flag of the selected country and the currency conversion rate from USD to the selected countries currency. Our target audience for this is travelers and our goal is to ease the traveling process.We wanted to capitalize on simplicity because traveling is enough stress on its own.
